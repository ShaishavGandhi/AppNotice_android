The COMPANY may in its sole discretion provide on or through the Properties links to certain websites owned and controlled by third parties (collectively, “Third Party Sites”).  These Third Party Sites have not necessarily been reviewed by the COMPANY and are owned, controlled and/or maintained solely by third parties over whom the COMPANY exercises no control.

    <br/>
    <li >DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. YOUR USE OF THE PROPERTIES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE PROPERTIES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES THAT THE PROPERTIES ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, VIRUS FREE, AND ABLE TO OPERATE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED BASIS, THAT THE PROPERTIES (OR THE FUNCTIONALITY THEREOF) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR PRODUCE YOUR EXPECTED RESULTS, OR THAT ERRORS IN THE PROPERTIES WILL BE CORRECTED, AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, ACCURACY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NEED, OR NON-INFRINGMENT.   IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE QUALITY OF MATERIALS OR DATA DOWNLOADED, UPLOADED, OR TRANSFERRED USING THE PROPERTIES. COMPANY ALSO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY THIRD PARTY INTERNET BROWSER OR PLATFORM WILL SUPPORT THE PROPERTIES.</li>
    <br/>
    <li >LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THE PROPERTIES OR WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROPERTIES, OR FOR ANY INFORMATION, SERVICES, PROGRAMS, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PROPERTIES, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF UTILIZATION OF THE PROPERTIES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, TOTAL LIABILITY FOR COMPANY FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER RELATED TO USE OF THE PROPERTIES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY A USER TO COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE PARTICULAR DISPUTE.</li>
    <br/>
    <li >REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  By downloading, accessing, or using the Properties, each User hereby represents and warrants that (i) the User is at least 18 years of age or the legal age of majority, whichever is greater; (ii) the User will at all times provide true, accurate, current, and complete information when submitting information to the COMPANY through the Properties; and (iii) the User will at all times comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms including, without limitation, the terms set forth in Section 1 (License Grant).  Any breach of the foregoing representations and warranties entitles the COMPANY to seek immediately (and without notice) all remedies available at law or equity.</li>
    <br/>
    <li >ENFORCEMENT.  Each User acknowledges that any breach, threatened or actual, of these Terms, including, without limitation, violations, or infringement of the COMPANY’s intellectual property or proprietary rights, may cause irreparable injury to the COMPANY, whereby such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and the COMPANY would not have an adequate remedy at law.  In the event of such injury or potential for such injury, each User therefore hereby agrees that the COMPANY shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of a User’s obligations under any provision of these Terms.</li>
    <br/>
    <li >ENFORCING SECURITY.  Any actual or attempted use of the Properties by a User in violation of these Terms may result in criminal and/or civil prosecution, including, without limitation, punishment under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 under U.S. federal law.  The COMPANY reserves the right in its sole discretion to review, monitor, and/or record any information relating to a User’s utilization of the Properties (collectively, “User Information”) without any prior notice to or permission from each applicable User, including, without limitation, by archiving content and/or communications submitted to and/or sent by a User through the Properties.  The COMPANY may share any User Information the COMPANY obtains from a User with any law enforcement organization in connection with any investigation or prosecution of possible criminal or unlawful activity.  The COMPANY will also disclose User Information as required by any court order and/or subpoena.  In addition, the COMPANY hereby reserves the right in its sole direction to at any time and without notice modify, suspend, terminate, and/or interrupt operation of or access to the Properties, or any portion thereof, in order to protect the Properties, the COMPANY, or the business interests of the COMPANY. </li>
    <br/>
    <li >TERM AND TERMINATION.  This Agreement will take effect each and every time that each User accesses and/or uses the Properties.  This Agreement will terminate automatically (i) if a User fails to fully comply with all of its terms and conditions; or (ii) when a User ceases all use of the Properties in connection with each separate visit.  Termination under the foregoing circumstances shall be effective without notice.  In addition, the COMPANY may in its sole discretion terminate these Terms upon notice to a User for any or no reason.  Upon termination of these Terms, all right(s) to use the Properties shall immediately cease.  Sections 2-4 and 6-14 shall survive the termination of these Terms in perpetuity.</li>
    <br/>
    <li >WAIVER &amp; SEVERABILITY.  The COMPANY’s failure to insist on upon strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of these Terms by a User will not operate as a waiver of any subsequent or other default or failure of performance.  If any part of these Terms is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law or court order including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and the liability limitations set forth above, then any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most clearly matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect.</li>
    <br/>
    <li >MISCELLANEOUS.  These Terms have been agreed upon and will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia.  No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between a User and the COMPANY as a result of these Terms or utilization of the Properties.  Headings are for convenience only.  These Terms represent the entire agreement between a User and the COMPANY with respect to use of the Properties, and hereby supersede all prior and/or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written between a User and the COMPANY with respect to the Properties.  Each User may not assign or transfer any rights under these Terms without the prior express written consent of the COMPANY, which may be withheld in the COMPANY’s sole discretion.  Please note that the COMPANY reserves in its sole discretion the right to change the terms and conditions of these Terms by posting a revised Agreement to the Properties.  In addition, the COMPANY may in its sole discretion, add, modify, and/or delete any aspect, functionality, service, program, or other feature of the Properties.  Each User hereby acknowledges and agrees that the COMPANY is under no obligation to upgrade, enhance, and/or modify the Properties under any circumstances.  A User’s continued use of the Properties following any announced change to these Terms will be deemed to conclusively signal your acceptance of any change to these Terms.  Therefore, each User should immediately stop all use of the Properties if a User does not agree any with any changes.</li>
